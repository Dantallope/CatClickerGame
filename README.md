# Kitty Clicker
### An HTML/JS zen clicker game. With cat!

## Description
Kitty Clicker is a clicker-style game that uses third party APIs to give motivational quotes and show the current weather on the background. The purpose of this game is to aid the user in relaxation by interacting with a digital cat. The features of this game include reactive weather and time conditions as well as responses from the cat once fed, watered, and played with. This game primarily uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 	
<br>
<br>Our main motivation for development is for relaxation content and entertainment. 


## User Story
As a stressed lover of cats 
<br>I want to click on a cute cat that gives motivational quotes, so we can be inspired to continue playing
<br>I want to be able to feed and water the cat by clicking on its respective icon, so I can interact with the hunger and thirst bars
<br>I want to play with the cat by clicking on it respective icon, so I can interact with the happiness bar
<br>I want to have a score bar that goes up as I raise the cat’s happiness level, so I can determine my score
<br>I want to have a digital clock on screen to show the users’ current time depending on their timezone, so I know whether I’d like to interact with the cat at a certain time. 
<br>I want to have the page react to the in-game time by changing page color schemes (i.e. nightmode, dawn, sunset).
<br>I want to be able to save my score so I can continue to interact with the cat at a later time.
<br>I want to have a weather tracker so the user has an accurate depiction of the weather outside of the cat’s window.

<br>Click on the food or water bowl and their respective meters will fill.
